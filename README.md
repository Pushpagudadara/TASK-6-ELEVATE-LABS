# Task 6 - Strong Password Creation & Evaluation

## Passwords Tested
1. 12345 → Very Weak  
2. Sharan123 → Weak  
3. CyberTask2025 → Medium  
4. S@ran!2025#Secure → Strong  
5. Xy_9*Lm$4oPq → Very Strong  

## Findings
- Password strength increases with **length** and **complexity**.
- Simple passwords are vulnerable to brute force and dictionary attacks.
- Strong passwords combine uppercase, lowercase, numbers, symbols, and are at least 12+ characters long.

## Best Practices
- Use long, random, unique passwords.
- Avoid dictionary words & personal info.
- Use password managers for secure storage.
- Enable multi-factor authentication (MFA) wherever possible.

## Conclusion
Password complexity directly improves resistance against brute force and dictionary attacks. Strong password habits are essential for cybersecurity.
